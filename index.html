        <p>The programming language is an official language with a series of instructions that provide different types of results. A programming language for computer programming is used to implement algorithms.<br>
            Most programming languages ​​are computer instructions. There are programmable machines that use a specific set of commands instead of normal programming languages. The first was the invention of a digital computer, and the first was probably the automatic flutist identified by the Moses brothers in Baghdad during the heyday of Islam in the 9th century. The programs have been used since the early 19th century to control the behavior of machines such as jacquards, jukeboxes and musical pianos. Programs on these machines (e.g. piano functions on the player) did not behave differently in response to different inputs or conditions.<br>
            Thousands of different programming languages ​​have been created and others have been created every year. Many programming languages ​​must be written (i.e. as a sequence of operations), while in other languages ​​a notification form is used (i.e. the desired result is obtained, not how to achieve it).<br>
            The definition of a programming language is generally divided into two components: syntax (module) and semantics (meaning). Some languages ​​are defined in the specification document (for example, C programming languages ​​are defined by the ISO standard), others (for example Perl) have a dominant application which is considered as a reference. In some languages, the base language is defined by the standard and extensions of the dominant practice are common.
