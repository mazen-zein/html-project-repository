        <h1>Importance of programming languages</h1>
        <p>A computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs. It is a computer that performs some kind of calculation or algorithm and can control external devices like printers, hard drives, robots. PostScript programs are usually created by another program to launch the printer screen or computer. In a more general sense, a programming language can abstractly describe machine calculations. It is believed that a complete specification of a programming language usually includes an ideal machine or processor definition for that language. In most cases, the programming language is a computer. For this reason, programming languages ​​are often defined and analyzed in this way. Programming languages ​​are different from natural languages ​​because natural languages ​​are only used to interact with humans, while programming languages ​​allow people to instruct machines.</p>
