                    It supports many formats for programming, but object-oriented programming is not implemented.<br>
                    Its software size is small compared to other languages.<br>
                    Handle equipment easily.</td>

                    Great language and very long time learning all its potential<br>
                    There are no virtual libraries to design graphical interfaces, originally created for low-level programming and hardware processing, not to create simple programs.<br>
                    Object-oriented programming is not supported.</td>

                    It supports many types of programming, in addition to object-oriented programming.<br>
                    Many consider it the ideal language for large and complex projects.<br>
                    It is very fast during implementation.<br>
                    Abundant sources and language books are abundant.<br>
                    The language community is large.</td>

                    The programmer does not provide much help and does not have libraries as powerful as other libraries, such as the Java language.<br>

                    Supports most aspects of object-oriented programming.<br>
                    Its integration with many database systems and its efficient work with it, but it is often used with Mysql system.<br>
                    Most hosts support them, if not all of them, which means that you will have no problem finding hosts at a price that suits your capabilities.<br>
                    It has many frameworks that help the programmer write clean, error-free and often error-free code.<br>
                    A very large community with many resources.</td>
                <td>Standard libraries in the language need more organization, because they contain functions that perform the same work with a different name for each.<br>
                    There is currently no full support for Unicode encoding, but full support is planned for future releases.</td>
