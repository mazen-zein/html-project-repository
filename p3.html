        <h1>Properties of programming languages</h1>
        <p>The programmer performs operations on information units such as storing, reading, and comparing them. Calculations can also be performed on them. Operations follow the specific rules of the language. The programming language has another role, which is to control the organization of conducting operations. It directs the implementation of its steps in the same sequence as it was written by the programmer.<br>
            The language also enables a selection and branching process, by entering a logical condition on which the computer chooses the direction of continuing the work: let us assume that the program the programmer wants to make divides two numbers that the user chooses, and the result appears on the screen, and it is known that dividing by zero is not permissible Accordingly, the programmer must specify in his program this choice: if the denominator is against zero, the program runs the computer and performs the operation and gives the result. But if the denominator is zero, then the program does not perform the operation, but rather warns that the user tried to divide by zero. And orders can be organized in another way, where the implementation of an order or a group of orders is done loop repeatedly, and orders can also be divided into sub-units each unit performs a specific work, and the goal is to divide the work into parts that are easy to work on separately in Ring loop body.<br>
            Each language has a special design in terms of handling the data, and in terms of the ways and facilities provided by the language to deal with a specific problem.<br>
            Programming languages ​​can be classified in terms of the way programs are built into procedural languages ​​(Basic, Fortran) which are serial languages, the basis of which they are built is the procedures to be applied to the data and the variables. Object languages ​​(C, Java, Delphi) are non-serial, and are based on the elements and variables used within the program to be converted, by applying a specific set of procedures to them.
