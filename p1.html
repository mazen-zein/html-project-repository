        <h1>Types of programming languages</h1>
        <p>Computational theory classifies languages ​​based on the calculations they can express. All complete Turing languages ​​can implement the same algorithm. ANSI / ISO SQL-92 and charities are examples of incomplete Turing languages, but are often called programming languages.<br>
            Markup languages ​​such as XML, HTML or troff that define structured data are generally not considered programming languages. However, programming languages ​​can share syntax with selection language if the semantics of the calculation is correct. For example, XSLT is an extended Turing language that takes full advantage of XML syntax. In addition, LaTeX, which is mainly used to structure documents, includes a complete Turing set.<br>
            The term "computer language" is sometimes used as a synonym for programming language. However, the use of the two terms varies depending on the author, including the exact scope of each term. One usage describes programming languages ​​as a subset of computer languages. Likewise, languages ​​used in computer science that serve a purpose other than printing computer programs are widely recognized languages. For example. Markup languages ​​are sometimes called computer languages ​​to emphasize that they are not intended for programming.<br>
            Another application is programming languages, such as theoretical designs for abstract machine and computer programming languages, as a subset of those running on physical computers with limited hardware resources. John C. Reynolds notes that formal specification languages ​​are as much programming languages ​​as languages ​​for execution. He also argues that the text input formats and even graphics affecting computer behavior are programming languages, although not generally included in Turing, and notes that the lack of understanding of language concepts is the cause of many gaps in programming Input formats.
